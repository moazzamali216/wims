                                <p>The entrepreneur will exercise the utmost care when receiving and executing orders
                                    for products and when assessing applications for the provision of services.</p>
                                <p>The place of delivery is the address that the consumer has provided to the company.
                                </p>
                                <p>Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article, the company will fulfill
                                    accepted orders expeditiously, but no later than within 30 days, unless the consumer
                                    has agreed to a longer delivery period. If delivery is delayed, or if an order
                                    cannot be fulfilled or can only be partially fulfilled, the consumer will be
                                    notified of this no later than 30 days after placing the order. In that case, the
                                    consumer has the right to terminate the agreement free of charge. The consumer is
                                    not entitled to compensation.</p>
                                <p>All delivery times are indicative. Consumers cannot derive any rights from any stated
                                    delivery times. Exceeding a delivery time does not entitle the consumer to
                                    compensation.</p>
                                <p>In the event of dissolution in accordance with paragraph 3 of this article, the
                                    entrepreneur will refund the amount paid by the consumer as soon as possible, but no
                                    later than 14 days after dissolution.</p>
                                <p>If delivery of an ordered product proves impossible, the entrepreneur will endeavor
                                    to provide a replacement item. The fact that a replacement item is being delivered
                                    will be clearly and comprehensibly communicated at the time of delivery. The right
                                    of withdrawal cannot be excluded for replacement items. The costs of any return
                                    shipping are borne by the entrepreneur.</p>
                                <p>The risk of damage and/or loss of products rests with the entrepreneur until the
                                    moment of delivery to the consumer or a previously designated representative made
                                    known to the entrepreneur, unless expressly agreed otherwise.</p>

                                    independent dispute committee appointed by WebwinkelKeur. The decision of this
                                    committee is binding, and both the entrepreneur and the consumer agree to this
                                    binding decision. Submitting a dispute to this dispute committee involves costs that
                                    the consumer must pay to the committee in question. It is also possible to register
